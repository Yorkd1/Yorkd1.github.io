    "text": "What’s in a Name?\n\n\n\nElevator pitch\nWhat is in a name? Why do we have periods of time where some names are more used than other names, and why do unused names from previous generations keep popping up in modern days? Our data will focus on the trends of names used within the US from the past 100 hundred years.\n\n\nRead and format project data\n# Point to the names_year.csv and store it in a variable.\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nQUESTION|TASK 1\nHow does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically?\nCompared to when I was born, in 1994, the name David was used a lot more in 1955 with over 64,700 people at it’s peak. Comparitively, when I was born the name belonged to just shy of 22,000 people.\n\n\nRead and format data\n# Use of David in the data.\nfig = px.line(df.query(\"name=='David'\"), x=\"year\", y=\"Total\", color='name', title='People Named David in the US')\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title = \"Years\",\n    yaxis_title = \"People Named David\",\n    legend_title = \"Name\"\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nQUESTION|TASK 2\nIf you talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, what is your guess of his or her age? What ages would you not guess?\nFrom the 1980’s to the 2000’s the name Brittany was fairly popular. If someone named Brittany was talking to me on the phone today, I would guess an age range of about 20-40 years. I definatley would not guess the age of 50 years or older since the name was closer to 0 before 1980, nor would I guess 15 years or younger for the same reason.\n\n\nRead and format data\n# People named Brittany over the years\nfig = px.line(df.query(\"name=='Brittany'\"), x=\"year\", y=\"Total\", color='name', title='People Named Brittany in the US')\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title = \"Years\",\n    yaxis_title = \"Population\",\n    legend_title = \"Name\"\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nQUESTION|TASK 3\nMary, Martha, Peter, and Paul are all Christian names. From 1920 - 2000, compare the name usage of each of the four names. What trends do you notice?\nGiven the names, they all seem to have been popular before the 1980’s. All these names have thier popularity peak around the 1950’s with Mary having the most names used, then Paul next with Peter and Martha last but looking similar numbers wise. The name Mary also tends to have another peak “season” at about the 1920’s.\n\n\nRead and format data\n# Names of Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul popularity\nfig = px.line(df.query(\"name==('Mary', 'Martha', 'Peter', 'Paul')\"), x=\"year\", y=\"Total\", color='name', title=\"People's Names in the US Over Time\")\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title = \"Years\",\n    yaxis_title = \"Population\",\n    legend_title = \"Name\"\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nQUESTION|TASK 4\nThink of a unique name from a famous movie. Plot the usage of that name and see how changes line up with the movie release. Does it look like the movie had an effect on usage?\n_I have always liked “How to Train Your Dragon,” and I even named my daughter after one of the characters in that show which was Astrid. The movie came out in 2010, so I wanted to see if that name had gained traction, so to speak, and to my surprise it did. In the data provided we see that when the movie came out the name Astrid had 124 people, and then in the following years it doubles. I honestly wish the data had a few more years of recorded dates so I could see the change more.\n\n\nRead and format data\n# Famous movie name: Astrid's popularity\nfig = px.line(df.query(\"name=='Astrid'\"), x=\"year\", y=\"Total\", color='name', title='People Named Astrid in the US')\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title = \"Years\",\n    yaxis_title = \"Population\",\n    legend_title = \"Name\"\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nSTRETCH QUESTION|TASK\nReproduce the chart Elliot using the data from the names_year.csv file.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Recreate the graph for Elliot\nfig = px.line(df.query(\"name=='Elliot'\"), x=\"year\", y=\"Total\", color='name', title='Elliot...

Now sometimes delays happen and probably at no fault of the airport that has informed travelers of these delays. Delay time can add up though, so if the total delay time is a significant number compaired to the rest then we can assume that this airport is the worst when it comes to flight delays.\n::: {#cell-Airport w/ worst delay times .cell execution_count=4}\n\nPlotting data\n# Chart that shows minutes_delayed_total for all airports.\n\nfig = px.bar(df,\n    x=\"airport_code\",\n    y=\"minutes_delayed_total\",\n    title=\"Airport Total Delays in Minutes\"\n)\nfig.update_layout(\n  yaxis_title = \"Total Minutes Delayed\",\n  xaxis_title = \"Airport Code\"\n)\nfig\n\n\n                                                \n\n:::\nFrom what we can see in the chart, Chicago O’Hare International Airport has the most amount of delays in minutes. Due to this being the case we can assume that this airport has the worst delays for having the longest wait times which can cause people to miss connecting flights or important events.\n\n\nBest Month To Fly\nWhat is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length?\nFor the metric, I chose total minutes delayed because we can see how many minutes total, per month in this case, to see the likelihood of a flight being delayed.

Describe what you learn from this graph.\nFrom what we learn by the data shown below is that Chicago O’Hare International and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airports suffer the most delays out of the year due to weather conditions. With Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International having the most delays, it might be in the best interest of travelers to not book flights or connecting flights that start in either of these airports.
